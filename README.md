# Village
Your health, your Village, your world.
## 👨‍💻 Mission
A health-centered social network made for the purpose of looking out for your friends and letting them know when you may need help.
## 🌐 Application
<a href="https://village-socialapp.herokuapp.com/">Link to the App</a>

## 💻 User Experience
When users load the page, they'll be prompted with the logo, a signup button, and a login button, all in front of a nice moving background. When the user clicks on Signup, they'll be given a form in which they must create an account by entering a username, email, and password, before clicking Submit to send the information through. When the user clicks on Login, they'll be given a form in which they must log into their account by entering their email and password, before clicking Submit to send the information through. After the user finishes up on the Signup or Login page, the browser will load the their Profile page, in which they'll see a SideNav that includes links to all the applications pages. The Profile page displays their health calendar, where their last seven mood entries will be displayed for the user. They may add a new entry with the plus button shown. The Village page will display posts made by all created accounts, where they may click an icon to show support (heart), or comment to enter in more specific support to the user that created the post. Clicking on the "Your World" link, for now, takes the user to WHO's official page. Clicking the Sign Out button will take the user back to the Welcome page and sign the user out.
